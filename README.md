Project Title: Individual State Health IT Privacy and Consent Laws and Policies


Description of the project:

For this project, I used the State Health IT Privacy and Consent Laws and Policies API from the following link: https://www.healthit.gov/data/open-api?source=state-health-it-privacy-consent-law-policies.csv. This API provides information on state-level policies and laws related to Health Information Exchange (HIE) consent, authorization requirements for the disclosure of mental health information for treatment, payment, and healthcare operations (TPO), and minimum necessary standards for the disclosure of mental health information.

To display the information in an interactive and user-friendly way, I used the leaflet JavaScript library to create a map that shows all 50 states and the District of Columbia. For the visualizations in my project, I used Leaflet's built-in features to display the map of the United States and the clickable state icons. I also used Flexbox as my CSS Framework to style the website. I added a load button that loads all the data for the different states and District of Columbia, and a search bar that enables users to filter the data by state. This makes it easy for users to find the information they need for a particular state.


The purpose of my project is to make it easy for patients and healthcare providers to understand the laws and policies related to patient consent for sharing personal health information, specifically related to mental health. By providing this information in an interactive and user-friendly way, I hope to increase awareness of patient rights and empower patients to make informed decisions about their personal health information.
